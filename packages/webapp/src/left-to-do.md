## Issues that remain to be done in this webapp

1. Names of the concepts that can be searched for should be entered in some config by the lang engineer.
2. The error list and search results shoudl not have a number, or perhaphs they shoudl have some ID.
3. Search for structure should be augmented with a view to enter the structure.
4. Delete model functionality should be added.
5. Styling should be improved.
6. When an item is selected in the info panel (error or search result), the cursor should jump to the corrsponding
element.
7. Code to import a unit should be moved to other place.
8. Progress indicator for importing unit.
9. Add comments on changes in SplitPane.
10. Split EditorCommunication in better to handle units, and address all todos.
11. See if a footer adds something to the page.
12. Find out how to set the address of the server.
13. Change generation of language/gen/index to use 'import type'.
14. When scrollbar is added to one of the splitpanes, the content moves => try to avoid this.
15. Adjust the z-indez of the mouse-catcher of SplitPane such that it stays behind the dialogs.

17. Maybe add a context menu to the model name in the navigator (drawer) to add new unit and import new unit.

19. Remove all unneeded console.logs.
20. Make sure Travis is ok.
