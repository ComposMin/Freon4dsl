Still to do in the documentation:

1. add dedicated email address in 'index.adoc' and 'wish-list.adoc'
2. improve pictures in 'projectional-editing.adoc'
3. add branch name for release candidate in 'installing.adoc'
4. check series of command in 'installing.adoc'
5. improve the jekyll generation of figures: like the asciidoc generation
6. the ascii-doc directive [start=5], where 5 can be any number, does not work in jekyll, but it does work in the preview
7. in 'first-language.adoc' check whether "yarn start" or "lerna run start" can be used from any package
8. in 'first-language.adoc' the [NOTE] directive does not work (it should add an icon from Font Awesome before the text block, jekyll-config is already adjusted)
9. add demo-uml-diagram in 'tutorials.adoc'
10. improve styling of keywords, i.e. words between ``
11. check all links
12. make the page title in the tab of the browser to remain 'Projectit'
13. make screenshots of the editor for every edit-def example
14. check the use of capitals in headers
15. the names in the framework tutorial are CoreTest instead of Demo=> what to do?
16. check the images in framework-tutorial.adoc
17. define common asciidoc attributes in jekyll's config file
18. make sure asciidoc knows how to display javescript source code (using pygments???)
