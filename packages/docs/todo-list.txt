Still to do in the documentation:

DONE 1. add dedicated email address in 'index.adoc' and 'wish-list.adoc'
LATER 2. improve pictures in 'projectional-editing.adoc'
DONE 3. add branch name for release candidate in 'installing.adoc'
DONE 4. check series of command in 'installing.adoc'
DONE 5. improve the jekyll generation of figures: like the asciidoc generation
LATER 6. the ascii-doc directive [start=5], where 5 can be any number, does not work in jekyll, but it does work in the preview
DONE 7. in 'first-language.adoc' check whether "yarn start" or "lerna run start" can be used from any package
DONE 8. in 'first-language.adoc' the [NOTE] directive does not work (it should add an icon from Font Awesome before the text block, jekyll-config is already adjusted)
DONE 9. add demo-uml-diagram in 'tutorials.adoc'
DONE 10. improve styling of keywords, i.e. words between ``
11. check all links
DONE 12. make the page title in the tab of the browser to remain 'Projectit'
13. make screenshots of the editor for every edit-def example
DONE 14. check the use of capitals in headers
DONE 15. the names in the framework tutorial are CoreTest instead of Demo => moved custom-projections to playground/tutorial
16. check the images in framework-tutorial.adoc
LATER 17. define common asciidoc attributes in jekyll's config file
LATER 18. make sure asciidoc knows how to display javescript source code (using pygments???)
19. JOS: rewrite the third-level pages on custom build projections and actions
20. JOS: add location of tutorial custom build projections in source code
21. JOS: write documentation on support for expressions
22. JOS: write more on name-based references
DONE 23. Decide whether the just-the-docs link should stay
DONE 24. See if the footer is ok
LATER 25. sublijsten dicht kunnen klappen (b.v. under the hood - interfaces - *)
26. JOS: de '>' marker in de navigator achter de titel zetten???
27. verwerk alle TODOs die nog in de tekst staan
