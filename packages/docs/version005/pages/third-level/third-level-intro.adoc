= Third Level Customization

Please, become acquainted with the xref:../intro/three-levels.adoc[three levels of language definitions] used by ProjectIt.
This section explains the third of these three levels.

Third level adaptability *per concept* is currently possible for:

* xref:./framework-tutorial.adoc[editor]
* xref:./validator-third-level.adoc[validator]

To add third level adaptability for both scoper and typer is one of the
entries in our xref:../intro/wish-list.adoc[wish list].

== Replacing a Pi-tool
All parts can be completely replaced. This is done by implementing the respective interface.
