In all tutorials we will be using the _Demo_ Entity language as example. The gist of the _Demo_ language is that it defines
a `Model`, which holds `Entities` and `Functions`. `Entities` can hold `Properties` and also hold `Functions`. Every `Function`
has a list of `Parameters` and an `Expression`.

We have a few other examples, for instance _TaxRules_, and _Heating_. You can find them in `/playground/src/`.
