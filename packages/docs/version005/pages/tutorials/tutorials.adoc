In all tutorials we will be using the _Entity_ language as example. The gist of the _Entity_ language is that it defines
serveral `EntityModelUnits`, each of which holds `Entities` and `Functions`. `Entities` can hold `Properties`
and can hold `Functions` too. Every `Function` has a list of `Parameters` and an `Expression`.
