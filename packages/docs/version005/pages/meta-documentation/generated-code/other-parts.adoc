= The Server and Webapp folders

For the language environment to function, more is needed than the code for the editor, validator and such. In particular,
there is a need for a server which can hold and provide stored users models, and for a small web application that
is able to show the editor, errors message, models that are available form the server, and so on.

We provide a minimal *server* that stores your user models in a json format. The code for the server can be found in the
`packages/server`. The stored models can be found in `packages/server/modelstore/[name-of-your-language]/`.

A simple *web application* is also provided. The code can be found in `packages/webapp`. A copy is put inside
`packages/playground` in order for the playground languages to function.

Note that both the server and the web application are provided for your convenience. We assume that when ProjectIt
is used in a larger context, these two parts will be interchanged with suitable choices by the language engineer
and team.
