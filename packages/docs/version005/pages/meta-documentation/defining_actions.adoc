= Defining Actions

In the ProjectIt editor all behavior is defined using actions.
Although ProjectIt is implemented using React, actions abstract away from this implementation.

Each action defines

* The trigger
* The action itself
* The boxes in which the action can be triggered
* An id for internal use

Let's take a look at the definition of a behavior:

[source]
----
export interface PiBehavior {
    /**
     * The trigger to activate this behavior
     */
    trigger: PiTriggerType;

    /**
     * The box roles in which this trigger is active
     */
    activeInBoxRoles: string[];

    /**
     * Optional callback function that returns whether the trigger is applicable for the specific box.
     */
    isApplicable?: (box: Box) => boolean;
    boxRoleToSelect?: string;
    caretPosition?: PiCaret;
}
----

User actions are attached to boxes.
This is done by adding these box roles to the `activeInBoxRoles` property of an action.

The `trigger` defines the keys that will trigger execution of the action.

//TODO: describe the optional properties

== Custom Actions
// TODO document custom actions

== Expressions and Binary Expressions
Advanced expression editing is described in xref:expressions.adoc[Expressions].

== Keyboard Shortcuts
A keyboard shortcut specifies an action that is triggered by special keys, like e.g. Ctrl-A.
