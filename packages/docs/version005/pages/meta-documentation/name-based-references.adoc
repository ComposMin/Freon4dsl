= Name Based References

Similar to expressions, in https://www.voelter.de/data/pub/fse2016-projEditing.pdf[Efficiency of Projectional Editing:
A Controlled Experiment] the authors name _references_ as another challenge for projectional editing.

[quote, Markus Voelter a.o., Efficiency of Projectional Editing]

*References.*
References are based on pointers to the targetnodeâ€™s ID. Despite some advantages (e.g., robust
refactorings) of this approach, we observe problems with the tradeoff that the reference target
has to exist at the time the reference is created.  A more robust and intuitive handling of
references is desirable.  While some problems can be solved by language developers (e.g.,
quick fixes to create reference targets), there should be a better way to support references
by the IDE itself.

The approach to references in ProjectIt is to used only name-based references which are resolve
on a need-to basis.
