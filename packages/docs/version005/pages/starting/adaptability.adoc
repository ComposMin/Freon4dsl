== The Five Parts of a Language Definition
A ProjectIt language definition consists of five parts:

. The language structure, or abstract syntax tree (AST) is defined in files with extension `.ast`.
. The concrete syntax of the language (CST), or editor definition, is defined in files with extension `.edit`.
. The scoping is defined in files with extension `.scope`.
. The typing is defined in files with extension `.type`.
. The validation is defined in files with extension `.valid`.

And yes, you can use multiple files to define one of the parts. For instance, ProjectIt will combine
multiple .ast files into one AST definition.

More on the content of each of these files can be found in the respective tutorials.
