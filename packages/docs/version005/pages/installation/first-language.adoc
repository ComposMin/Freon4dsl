= Create Your Own Language

Naturally, you will want to create your own language definitions. To do so, follows these steps.

.	Add a new folder for your language in `packages/playground/src`, create a dedicated folder within it. We usually
call it ‘defs’, but any name will do, just keep all language definition files in it. Next, adjust
the scripts in playground’s package.json, as shown in the following screenshot. Use your own folders instead of
`src/taxrules/defs` and `src/taxtrules`.

.	Create a (set of) language definition(s). To start with, you only need to define the language structure,
defaults will be generated for the editor, scoper, typer, and validator. You can start by copying `TaxRules.lang`
to your own `defs`-folder. See the xref:../tutorials/tutorials.adoc[tutorials]
to find out how to write the definitions for the language structure, editor, scoper, typer, and validator.

.	Generate the code using the adjusted script in package.json. In the above example this would be done by:

    yarn taxrules

.   Adjust the configuration file in *playground/src/webapp/gateway-to-projectit/WebappConfiguration.ts* to use the
newly generated editor instead of the editor for the 'Demo' example.

.   Try it out:

    yarn start or lerna run start

.	If you like, add other definitions or change the existing ones, and generate another time (Again,
see the xref:../tutorials/tutorials.adoc[tutorials] to find out more about the definitions, and maybe you want to use
the -w flag to watch changes to your definition files.). Careful with handmade changes, all files in
any ‘gen’ folder will be deleted during the next generation.
.	If you like, have a look at the generated code (see also xref:structure-generated-code.adoc[structure of the generated code]).
.	If you like, add handwritten code to improve the result (see xref:meta-documentation/editor-framework.adoc[editor framework]).
