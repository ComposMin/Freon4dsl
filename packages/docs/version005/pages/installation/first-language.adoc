= Create Your Own Language

Naturally, you will want to create your own language definitions. To do so, follows these steps.

.	Add a new folder for your language in `packages/playground/src`. Next, create a dedicated folder within it, to hold
the definition files for your language. We usually call it _defs_, but any name will do. Next, adjust
the scripts in playgroundâ€™s _package.json_. In the following screenshot, we show how to create a script for the language
`taxrules`. Use the name of your language and your own folders instead of `src/taxrules/defs` and `src/taxtrules`.

.	Create a (set of) language definition(s). To start with, you only need to define the language structure,
defaults will be generated for the editor, scoper, typer, and validator. You can start by copying `TaxRules.lang`
to your own `defs`-folder. See the xref:../tutorials/tutorials.adoc[tutorials]
to find out how to write the definitions for the language structure, editor, scoper, typer, and validator.

.	Generate the code using the adjusted script in _package.json_. In the above example this would be done by:

    yarn taxrules

.   Adjust the configuration file in *playground/src/webapp/gateway-to-projectit/WebappConfiguration.ts* to use the
newly generated editor instead of the editor for the 'Demo' example. Again, we show how to do this for the taxrules
example, in the following screenshot.

[start=5]
.   Try it out:

    yarn start or lerna run start

.	Next, it's playtime:
.. Add other definitions or change the existing ones, and generate another time. (Again,
see the xref:../tutorials/tutorials.adoc[tutorials] to find out more about the definitions, and maybe you want to use
the -w flag to watch changes to your definition files.)
[NOTE]
Be careful with handmade changes, all files in
any folder called _gen_ will be deleted during the next generation.
..	Have a look at the generated code (see also xref:../meta-documentation/generated-code/structure-generated-code.adoc[structure of the generated code]).
..	Add handwritten code to improve the result (see xref:../meta-documentation/framework/editor-framework.adoc[editor framework]).
..  And have fun ...
