= Create Your Own Language

Naturally, you will want to create your own language definitions. To do so, follows these steps.

.	Create a new project by cloning ProjectIt template project. The template project contains a generic
web application that acts as a shell for your generated editor.

.   Create a folder for your language in `/src`, to hold the definition files for your language.
We usually call it _defs_, but any name will do. (In this tutorial, the name _defs_ will be used.)

.   Next, adjust the `scripts` entry in the _package.json_ file. The `generate`
script should include your _defs_ folder and the folder where you want the generated code to be stored.
In the following screenshot, we use `src/defs` and `src/picode`.

.	Create a language definition. To start with, you only need to define the language structure,
defaults will be generated for the editor, scoper, typer, and validator. You can, for instance, copy
`EntityLanguage.lang` from the ProjectIt example to your own `defs`-folder. Or you can follow the
tutorial on the xref:../tutorials/langdef-tutorial.adoc[language structure definition].

.	Generate the code:

    yarn generate

.   Adjust the configuration file in */src/webapp/WebappConfiguration.ts* to use the
newly generated editor. Be sure to uncomment the lines as well.

.   Try it out:

    yarn start

.	Next, it's playtime:
.. Add other definitions or change the existing ones, and generate another time. See the
xref:../tutorials/tutorials.adoc[tutorials]
to find out how to write the definitions for the language structure, editor, scoper, typer, and validator.
Also, you may want to add the -w flag to the generate script to
watch changes to your definition files.

[NOTE]
Be careful with handmade changes, all files in
any folder called _gen_ will be deleted during the next generation.

..	Have a look at the generated code (see xref:../meta-documentation/generated-code/structure-generated-code.adoc[structure of the generated code]).
..	Add handwritten code to improve the result (see xref:../meta-documentation/framework/editor-framework.adoc[editor framework]).
..  And have fun ...
