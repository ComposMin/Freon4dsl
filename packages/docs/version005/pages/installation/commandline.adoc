= Use ProjectIt from the Commandline

ProjectIt will be released as a commandline tool. If you look at the package.json file in `packages/playground/`
you can find the commands that were used to run the Demo example.

Go to folder `packages/playground` and type ‘`ts-node ../meta/src/commandline/projectit`’ to find out the different
arguments that can be used.

Note that the commands _meta-it_ through to _type-it_, used solely (without the other commands) generate code that
does not compile correctly. For instance, both the scoper and validator might need to use the typer, therefore the
code seeks to include the typer class, which might not be generated yet. Likewise, the editor seeks to include
the scoper. Best way to go about is to use the _all_ command. Next, when you focus on one of the aspects of your
language, you can use the specific command for that aspect. Thus, you can keep regeneration-time as short as possible.
