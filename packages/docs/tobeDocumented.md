Changes made from version 0.1.0 onwards that still need to be documented:

1. initial values are allowed for all properties of every concept.
2. quotes are no longer allowed around the values of properties of 
instances of limited concepts, for number and boolean types.
3. model units are always namespaces
4. pathnames can be used as references (if editor is adjusted)
