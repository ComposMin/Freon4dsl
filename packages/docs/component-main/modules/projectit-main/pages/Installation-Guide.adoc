= Installing ProjectIt

The main prerequisites are: https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and https://yarnpkg.com/[yarn].
We are typically using the latest versions of both, although older versions likely work just as well.
You could also try and use NPM instead of yarn.

To install all dependencies:

    yarn install

To build and run the demo locally:

    yarn start

This will open a browser with the demo app on `http://localhost:3000/`.
The demo app is work in progress.
