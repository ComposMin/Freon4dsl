= Installing ProjectIt

You can find the project on https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt[Github] or www.project.it.org. The main prerequisites are: https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and https://yarnpkg.com/[yarn]. We are typically using the latest versions of both, although older versions likely work just as well.
You could also try and use NPM instead of yarn.

Start with cloning the repository

    git: clone https://github.com/projectit-org/ProjectIt

To install all dependencies:

    yarn install

To build and run the demo locally:

    yarn start

This will open a browser with the demo app on `http://localhost:3000/`.
The demo app is work in progress.
