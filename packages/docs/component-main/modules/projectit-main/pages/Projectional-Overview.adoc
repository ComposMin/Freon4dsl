= ProjectIt Overview

== Generated Editors

The overall flow in a projectional editor generated by ProjectIt is as follows:

1. The model/AST is mapped to a visual presentation (the projection).
2. The projection is shown to the user.
3. The user performs an action on the projection.
4. The action on the projection is mapped to an action on the model/AST.
5. (or 1 again) The changed model/AST is (re)mapped to a visual representation.

The xref:Editor-Boilerplate.adoc[editor boilerplate code] takes care of storing the model/AST. When the user triggers the actions _save_ or _open_ the AST is transformed into an JSON object and pushed to or retrieved from a server. (Jos: meer...)

Currently, the server is hosted locally. In future, we plan to use github for storing models. This is an intermediate solution for as long as ProjectIt is not integrated in a workbench. In order to integrate ProjectIt into a language workbench this connection to the server needs to be adjusted.

== The Generator and Metamodels

The overall workflow for using the ProjectIt generator is as follows:

1. The metamodel/AST definition is created.
2. The editor definition is created.
3. The editor is generated.
4. The editor projects a model/AST according to the AST definition.
