= ProjectIt Editor Overview

The overall flow in the ProjectIt projectional editor is as follows:

1. The model/AST is mapped to a visual presentation (the projection).
2. The Projection is shown to the user.
3. The user performs an action on the projection.
4. The action on the projection is mapped to an action on the model/AST.
5. (or 1 again) The changed model/AST is (re)mapped to a visual representation.

== Projection
The projection from your model/AST is defined by implementing the
_PiProjection_ interface:

[source]
----
include::{src-dir}/core/src/language/PiProjection.ts[tag=PiProjection]
----

Implementing this interface should return a _Box_ for each `element` in the AST.
ProjectIt includes boxes of various types (textual, tabular, horizontal or vertical collections, etc.)
to define this projection.
The box model is further described in xref:Defining_Projections.adoc#Defining Projections[Defining Projections].

== Behavior
The behavior of the editor is tightly coupled to the boxes in the projection because
the focus in the editor is always on a _Box_.

To be able to couple behavior to boxes, it is important to understand the following.
Each box in a projection keeps a reference to the element in the AST which it represents.
In addition each _Box_ has a _role_, which must be unique within all boxes for a specific
AST element.
This allows boxes to be uniquely identified by the combination of the AST element and the box role.

Each behavior has one or more _box roles_, specifying that the behavior is only active
in boxes with that specific role.
Furthermore a behavior has a _trigger_, describing the key(s) that will trigger the behavior,
and an _action_,  which is a typescript/javascript function the will be executed when the
behavior is being triggered.

Actions are further described in xref:Defining_Actions.adoc[Actions].

== AST Access
As ProjectIt uses the AST for projections and behavior, it needs to know about the type of elements in the AST.
To allow ProjectIt to work, each element type that occurrs in the AST needs to implement the `PiElement` interface.
This interface is kept as small as possible, to allow ProjectIt to be used for any AST.

[source]
----
include::{src-dir}/core/src/language/PiModel.ts[tag=PiElement]
----

The main two elements in this interface are:

* `piId()`, which should return en unique id for each element in the AST.
* `piContainer()` which should return a descriptor for the container (parent) of an element in the AST.

The two functions `piIsExpression()` and `piIsBinaryExpression()` are only needed when your language
contains expressions, as ProjectIt includes special handling of expressions.
To start with, these functions can be defined to simply return `false`.

Note that ProjectIt does not need to know anything about the structure of your language.
No need to know the availale element type, nor the properties of en element type, nor anything else.
This is by design, as ProjectIt is not meant to be a full Language Workbench,
but instead meant to be used with multiple language workbenches , or none.
