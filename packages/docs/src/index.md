# Projectional Editor Overview

The overall flow in a projectional editor is as follows:

1. The model/AST is mapped to a visual presentation (the projection)
2. The Projection is shown to the user
3. The user performs an action on the projection
4. The action on the projection is mapped to an action on the model/AST.
